Here is a recipe my family made a lot. It takes about 20 min and it's very simple.

Ingredients:
-Pasta.
-Zucchini/yellow squash.
-Feta.
-Garlic.

Recipe:
Put water on for pasta. Slice squash about 1/8" thick half moons. Saut√© in olive oil & salt until translucent. Add pasta to water when it boils. Add sliced garlic and herbs (basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme), saute for 2 min, add black pepper. Drain pasta, mix with squash and crumbled feta.


I routinely make this exact recipe but with chopped onion & peppers instead of zucchini/squash. Simple but delicious.
