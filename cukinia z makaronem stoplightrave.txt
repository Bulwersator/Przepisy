20 min
2 porcje

Pasta 200g
Zucchini 2x
Feta 130g
Garlic 2 cloves

Put water on for pasta. Slice zucchini about 3mm thick half moons. Sauté in olive oil & salt until translucent. Add pasta to water when it boils. Add sliced garlic and herbs (basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme), saute for 2 min, add black pepper. Drain pasta, mix with zucchini and crumbled feta.

I routinely make this exact recipe but with chopped onion & peppers instead of zucchini/squash. Simple but delicious.
